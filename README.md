# Getting started with Toolchest in Python

## Intro

This repo has a Jupyter notebook with a basic microbiome analysis â€“ from raw FASTQs to plots.

If you'd rather jump straight to a working version of this Jupyter notebook, head over to

## Setup

### Python dependencies

Quickest: from this directory, run`pip install -r ./requirements.txt`

Manual: install `matplotlib`, `toolchest-client`, and `pandas`

### Toolchest key

Sign up for a free key, and replace the call to `toolchest.set_key("YOUR_KEY_HERE")` with your key.

### Installing Jupyter

If you don't already have Toolchest installed locally, follow the
[Jupyter install guide](https://jupyter.org/install).

## Running

Run `jupyter notebook microbiome_analysis.ipynb` from inside the project to start a Jupyter notebook.

That should be it! You can advance through the notebook with the "Run" button, or however you like to run Jupyter
notebooks.
